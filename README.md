What rules would we make for a society if we did not know which member we would be?

### Summary
More often than not decision makers have great ideas to help certain people, but the implementation of these ideas may not help the intended citizens.  This project seeks to build a virtual veil of ignorance: a tool allowing a decision maker to examine how their decisions will affect a specific member of a US state.  The application uses U.S. Census data to generates a probable citizen with demographic information according to each state's distribution of data.  It also visualizes the distribution of data for each state while comparing it to the nation as a whole.

### Team Roles
One role was to access, clean, and load the Census data to the website; another to visualize the data with supplementary charts; a third to build the interactive map connecting each state to the correct data; and my role of hosting the website with Heroku, ensuring the appropriate library dependencies are up-to-date. 

### Individual Responsibilities
A part of verifying our website worked as intended on the Heroku server was making sure other group members were aware of where the production data is stored.  One recurring issue was accessing the data using dynamic filepaths instead of absolute paths.  Helping members resolve these issues meant understanding the other roles enough to integrate each process seamlessly.  Through these endeavors I learned more about the connections between various programming languages (Python, Unix, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), frameworks (Flask, Jinja,
